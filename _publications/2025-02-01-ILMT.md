excerpt: 'The International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) project was motivated by the need for an inexpensive 4 metre diameter optical telescope that could be devoted entirely to astronomical surveys. Its scientific programmes include the detection and study of transients, variable objects, asteroids, comets, space debris and low surface brightness galaxies. To this end, a collaboration was formed between the Institute of Astrophysics and Geophysics (Li√®ge University, Belgium), several Canadian universities (University of British Columbia, Laval University, University of Montreal, University of Toronto, York University, University of Victoria) and the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES, India).'
