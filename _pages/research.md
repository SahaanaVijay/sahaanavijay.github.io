"Brook no compromise: How to negotiate a united front" 
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
Factional conflict is pervasive across diverse settings, including coalition governments, political parties, and authoritarian elites. In attempting to resolve such conflicts, why do some factions prevail, while others fall into line? And what explains cases where factions sometimes fail to unite, prolonging stalemates and even precipitating collective downfall? I analyze a model where two groups prefer different policies, but must commit to the same one to overturn a mutually unfavorable status quo. Crucially, groups do not know each other's willingness to compromise,  i.e. whether they would rather stay with the status quo than accept their less-preferred policy. Groups unwilling to compromise in this sense commit to policies quickly, while those that are willing to compromise face a trade-off between delaying and gaining information about their counterpart, and committing preemptively to force their preferred policy through. Delay is indicative of willingness to compromise, but its costliness opens the door to avoidable miscoordination, in which impulsive commitment results in the status quo, although an alternative better for both groups was feasible. I analyze how avoidable miscoordination vary with model primitives, and show that when overall welfare increases when groups' willingness to compromise are more likely to be leaked.

An influential body of scholarship argues that authoritarian regimes design "hard" propaganda that is intentionally heavy-handed in order to signal regime power. In this study, by contrast, we link the power of propaganda to the emotional power of “soft” propaganda such as television dramas and viral social media content. We conduct a series of experiments in which we expose over 6,800 respondents in China to real propaganda videos drawn from television dramas, state-backed social media accounts, and state-run newscasts, each containing nationalist messages favored by the Chinese Communist Party. In contrast to theories that propaganda is unpersuasive, we show that propaganda effectively manipulates anger as well as anti-foreign sentiment and behavior, with heightened anti-foreign attitudes persisting up to a week. However, we also find that nationalist propaganda has no effect on perceptions of Chinese government performance or on self-reported willingness to protest against the state.

How do citizens react to authoritarian responsiveness? To investigate this question, we study how Chinese citizens reacted to a novel government initiative which enabled social media users to publicly post requests for COVID-related medical assistance. To understand the effect of this initiative on public perceptions of government effectiveness, we employ a two-part empirical strategy. First, we conduct a survey experiment in which we directly expose subjects to real help-seeking posts, in which we find that viewing posts did not improve subjects' ratings of government effectiveness, and in some cases worsened them. Second, we analyze over 10,000 real-world Weibo posts to understand the political orientation of the discourse around help-seekers. We find that negative and politically critical posts far outweighed positive and laudatory posts, complementing our survey experiment results. To contextualize our results, we develop a theoretic framework to understand the effects of different types of responsiveness on citizens' political attitudes. We suggest that citizens' negative reactions in this case were primarily influenced by public demands for help, which illuminated existing problems and failures of governance.
