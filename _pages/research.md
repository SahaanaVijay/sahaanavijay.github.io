"Brook no compromise: How to negotiate a united front" *(Scheduled MPSA 2023; Presented SPSA 2023. E-mail for draft.)* 
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
Two groups prefer different versions of a policy, but must commit to the same version for it to pass. Groups can only commit once, and do so permanently. Neither group knows  other's willingness to compromise -- whether it would rather fail to reach an agreement than accept the other group's preferred version. I show that groups that are unwilling to compromise commit as soon as possible, while those that are willing delay commitment. I characterize the optimal delay that solves the trade-off between committing quickly to force an opponent's hand and waiting to gain information about the opponent, and show that groups at an informational disadvantage act more conservatively. Finally, I analyze the likelihood of avoidable negotiation failure, i.e. when groups fail implement a Pareto improvement although one was possible.

An influential body of scholarship argues that authoritarian regimes design "hard" propaganda that is intentionally heavy-handed in order to signal regime power. In this study, by contrast, we link the power of propaganda to the emotional power of “soft” propaganda such as television dramas and viral social media content. We conduct a series of experiments in which we expose over 6,800 respondents in China to real propaganda videos drawn from television dramas, state-backed social media accounts, and state-run newscasts, each containing nationalist messages favored by the Chinese Communist Party. In contrast to theories that propaganda is unpersuasive, we show that propaganda effectively manipulates anger as well as anti-foreign sentiment and behavior, with heightened anti-foreign attitudes persisting up to a week. However, we also find that nationalist propaganda has no effect on perceptions of Chinese government performance or on self-reported willingness to protest against the state.

How do citizens react to authoritarian responsiveness? To investigate this question, we study how Chinese citizens reacted to a novel government initiative which enabled social media users to publicly post requests for COVID-related medical assistance. To understand the effect of this initiative on public perceptions of government effectiveness, we employ a two-part empirical strategy. First, we conduct a survey experiment in which we directly expose subjects to real help-seeking posts, in which we find that viewing posts did not improve subjects' ratings of government effectiveness, and in some cases worsened them. Second, we analyze over 10,000 real-world Weibo posts to understand the political orientation of the discourse around help-seekers. We find that negative and politically critical posts far outweighed positive and laudatory posts, complementing our survey experiment results. To contextualize our results, we develop a theoretic framework to understand the effects of different types of responsiveness on citizens' political attitudes. We suggest that citizens' negative reactions in this case were primarily influenced by public demands for help, which illuminated existing problems and failures of governance.
