Welcome! I am a Ph.D candidate in Politics at Princeton University, where I am affiliated with the Research Program in Political Economy and the Program for Quantitative and Analytical Political Science. I am grateful to be advised by Matias Iaryczower, Germ√°n Gieczewski, and Carles Boix. 

My dissertation research employs formal theory to study coordination and collective action problems. Additionally, my empirical research on propaganda and social media in China has been published in Comparative Political Studies and Chinese Sociological Review. 

Prior to Princeton, I worked as a Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the Financial Intermediation function. I hold an A.B. in Economics from the University of Chicago.
