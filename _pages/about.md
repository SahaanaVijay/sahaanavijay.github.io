Welcome! I am a Ph.D candidate in Politics at Princeton University, where I am affiliated with the Research Program in Political Economy and the Program for Quantitative and Analytical Political Science. I am grateful to be advised by Matias Iaryczower, Germán Gieczewski, and Carles Boix. Starting summer 2025, I will be an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. 

My current research studies the dynamics of group decision-making in weakly institutionalized settings. I seek to elucidate how the decision-making process itself — the time spent on deliberation, enforcing group discipline, and testing courses of action — can shape the outcomes of coordination and collective action.

Previously, I worked as a Research Analyst at the New York Fed and earned an A.B. in Economics from the University of Chicago.
