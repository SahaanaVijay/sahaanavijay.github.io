Hello, my name is Sahaana. I’m a rising senior at Ashoka University majoring in physics, with a concentration in astronomy. My research interests lie at the interface of nonlinear dynamics, chaos and machine learning, particularly how tools like reservoir computing and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be used to model complex systems, especially how we can use these architectures to better understand complex networks in neuroscience, ecology or even climate dynamics. Equally, I am interested in how principles from nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics can shape more interpretable and efficient algorithms.

I have previously worked with/under the supervision of Prof. Somendra Bhattacharjee (Ashoka), Prof. Ramakrishna Ramaswamy (IIT-D), Dr. Jean Surdej (ULiège), and Dr. Sergi Gonzàlez-Solís (LANL) on projects ranging from data analysis in particle physics and astronomy to multistability and synchronisation in coupled chaotic systems. For my undergraduate thesis, I am currently advised by Profs. [Bikram Phookun](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/bikram-phookun/), [Abhinav Gupta](https://www.ststephens.edu/department-of-physics/dr-abhinav-gupta/), and [Ramakrishna Ramaswamy](https://loopynoodle.github.io/ramramaswamy.org). This summer, however, I will be working with Dr. Shravan Hanasoge at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research on applying transformer-based architectures to detect low signal-to-noise transits in large-scale, noisy exoplanet survey data such as TESS.

Outside of physics, I am usually off the grid hiking in the mountains or travelling, working on my next digital art piece or binge-reading thriller, fantasy or sci-fi books.

I always welcome interesting conversations and new ideas — whether it's about research, side-quests or anything in between — don’t hesitate to get in touch!
