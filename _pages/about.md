Hello! My name is Sahaana and I’m a final-year bachelor's student at Ashoka University majoring in physics. My research interests focus on mathematical and computational frameworks to study complex systems, especially those that are nonlinear, higher-dimensional, and often chaotic.  I am particularly interested in how tools from dynamical systems theory, network science, and computation can be used to understand these systems better, with applications to areas such as ecology and biology, and even complex adaptive systems in war and politics (which would come under computational social science but there is an interesting read by Santa Fe Institute on chaos and arms race models [here](https://sfi-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/sfi-edu/production/uploads/sfi-com/dev/uploads/filer/7f/e0/7fe0aefe-e051-4f15-a94c-999be0a1ef57/91-09-032.pdf)!).

I have previously worked with/under the supervision of Prof. Somendra Bhattacharjee (Ashoka), Prof. Ramakrishna Ramaswamy (IIT-D), Dr. Jean Surdej (ULiège), and Dr. Sergi Gonzàlez-Solís (LANL) on projects ranging from data analysis in particle physics and astronomy to multistability and synchronisation in coupled chaotic systems. For my undergraduate thesis, I am currently working on reservoir computing using dynamical systems under Profs. [Bikram Phookun](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/bikram-phookun/), [Abhinav Gupta](https://www.ststephens.edu/department-of-physics/dr-abhinav-gupta/), and [Ramakrishna Ramaswamy](https://ramramaswamy.org).

Outside of physics, I am usually off the grid hiking in the mountains, working on my next digital art piece or binge-reading books. I am also into long-distance running and biking.

I always welcome interesting conversations and new ideas – whether it's about research, side-quests or anything in between – feel free to reach out!
