Hello! My name is Sahaana and Iâ€™m a senior at Ashoka University majoring in physics, with a concentration in astronomy. My research interests focus on mathematical and computational frameworks to study complex systems, especially those that are nonlinear, higher-dimensional, and often chaotic.  I am particularly interested in how tools from dynamical systems theory, network science, and machine learning (like reservoir computing and recurrent neural networks) can be used to understand these systems better, with applications to areas like neuroscience, mathematical biology, ecological networks and even climate dynamics. I am equally interested in how principles from statistical physics can inform the design of more efficient and interpretable algorithms.  

I have previously worked with/under the supervision of Prof. Somendra Bhattacharjee (Ashoka), Prof. Ramakrishna Ramaswamy (IIT-D), Dr. Jean Surdej (ULiÃ¨ge), and Dr. Sergi GonzÃ lez-SolÃ­s (LANL) on projects ranging from data analysis in particle physics and astronomy to multistability and synchronisation in coupled chaotic systems. For my undergraduate thesis, I am currently advised by Profs. [Bikram Phookun](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/bikram-phookun/), [Abhinav Gupta](https://www.ststephens.edu/department-of-physics/dr-abhinav-gupta/), and [Ramakrishna Ramaswamy](https://ramramaswamy.org). This summer, however, I am working with [Dr. Shravan Hanasoge](https://www.tifr.res.in/seismo/people.html) at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research on applying deep learning architectures to detect low signal-to-noise transits in large-scale, noisy exoplanet survey data, particularly TESS.

Outside of physics, I am usually off the grid hiking in the mountains or travelling, working on my next digital art piece or binge-reading books.

I always welcome interesting conversations and new ideas â€“ whether it's about research, side-quests or anything in between â€“ feel free to reach out!
