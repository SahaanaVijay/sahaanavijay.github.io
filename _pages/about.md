Hello! My name is Sahaana and I’m a senior at Ashoka University majoring in physics, with a concentration in astronomy. My research interests focus on mathematical and computational frameworks to study complex systems, especially those that are nonlinear, higher-dimensional, and often chaotic.  I am particularly interested in how tools from dynamical systems theory, network science, and machine learning (like reservoir computing and recurrent neural networks) can be used to understand these systems better, with applications to areas such as ecology, biology, climate dynamics and even complex adaptive systems in war and politics (which would come under computational social science but there is an interesting read by Santa Fe Institute on chaos and arms race models [here](https://sfi-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/sfi-edu/production/uploads/sfi-com/dev/uploads/filer/7f/e0/7fe0aefe-e051-4f15-a94c-999be0a1ef57/91-09-032.pdf)!). I am equally interested in how principles from statistical physics can inform the design of more efficient and interpretable algorithms.  

I have previously worked with/under the supervision of Prof. Somendra Bhattacharjee (Ashoka), Prof. Ramakrishna Ramaswamy (IIT-D), Dr. Jean Surdej (ULiège), and Dr. Sergi Gonzàlez-Solís (LANL) on projects ranging from data analysis in particle physics and astronomy to multistability and synchronisation in coupled chaotic systems. For my undergraduate thesis, I am currently working on reservoir computing using dynamical systems under Profs. [Bikram Phookun](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/bikram-phookun/), [Abhinav Gupta](https://www.ststephens.edu/department-of-physics/dr-abhinav-gupta/), and [Ramakrishna Ramaswamy](https://ramramaswamy.org).

Outside of physics, I am usually off the grid hiking in the mountains or travelling, working on my next digital art piece or binge-reading books.

I always welcome interesting conversations and new ideas – whether it's about research, side-quests or anything in between – feel free to reach out!
