Welcome! I am a Ph.D candidate in Politics at Princeton University, where I am affiliated with the Research Program in Political Economy and the Program for Quantitative and Analytical Political Science. My dissertation research uses formal theory and quantitative methods to study decentralized collective action. Broadly, I ask how and whether agents can coordinate on goals while also finding out about each others' preferences. By doing so, I seek to update our understanding of phenomena such as social movements, online mobs, and intra-elite conflicts. I am grateful to be advised by Matias Iaryczower, Germ√°n Gieczewski, and Carles Boix. 

In addition to my dissertation research, my work on propaganda and social media in China has been published in Comparative Political Studies and Chinese Sociological Review. 

Prior to Princeton, I worked as a Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the Financial Intermediation function, and earned an A.B. in Economics from the University of Chicago.
